Paolo holds a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and a Ph.D. in Energy and Nuclear Science and Technology. A mathematician and physicist wannabe, he eventually falled in love with computational physics, once he found it to be a cheap source of dopamine for his brain reward system. With a special interest in CFD and related fields, Large Eddy Simulation and Immersed Boundary Methods have become his main area of expertise. A Fortran integralist, he tries to keep a low profile doing more blatant stuff in C++ and Qt.
